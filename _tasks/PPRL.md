title: Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage
---

Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of identifying and matching records that represent the
same entity across databases held by different organizations without revealing any sensitive information
about these entities. At the end of the PPRL process only limited information about record pairs that have
been classified as matches (i.e .refer to the same entity) will be revealed either to the two databases
involved in a linkage, or to an external party.

Besides the two main challenges of record linkage, namely linkage quality and scalability of linking increasingly
large databases, priavacy poses another major challenge that needs to be adressed in many real-world record
linkage applications. PPRL methods need  to be secure to a variety of attacks, including dictionary, frequency or
more sophisticated crypt-analysis attacks.
