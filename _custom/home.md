# Welcome!

These are the web pages for the **Data Linkage Repository**.

The repository contains
a list of [data sets]({{ "/datasets" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) used in the literature,
and a list of data linkage [tasks]({{ "/tasks" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Each data set and task contains references to relevant publications,
and provides a way of citing them in future publications.

The website is intended to be maintained by the community.
We welcome contributions via [GitHub](http://www.github.com/dlrep/dlrep).
