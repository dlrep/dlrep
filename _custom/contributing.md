The website is intended to be maintained by the community.
We welcome contributions via [GitHub](http://www.github.com/dlrep/dlrep).

We will write a contributor's guideline and put it in here.

Maybe we can do that by describing how to do certain things:

## Working with GitHub

- Make an account,
- fork,
- branch,
- commit, commit commit,
- push,
- make pull request.

Then somebody will merge your changes.

You (or a maintainer) may need to make some more commits & pushes before the merge.

We will setup a build bot, so the changes can be previewed before a merge.

## Adding a new data set

## Editing existing data sets

## Etc...
