## Description

The Cora data contains bibliographic records of machine learning papers that have been manually clustered into groups that
refer to the same publication.

Originally, Cora was prepared by Andrew McCallum, and his versions of this data set are available on his
[Data](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data.html) web page.
The data is also hosted [here](cora.csv) in the DLRep.

Note that various versions of the Cora data set have been used by many publications in record linkage and entity resolution
over the years.

## Files
