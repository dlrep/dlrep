## Description

This external data set is hosted on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml) named
as [Record Linkage Comparison Patterns Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Record+Linkage+Comparison+Patterns).

It contains attribute-wise comparisons of health records with personal details, and the task is to decide from the
comparison patterns if the corresponding records refer to the same person or not.

Detailed information about the data set are given on the
[UCI ML Repository data set page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Record+Linkage+Comparison+Patterns).
