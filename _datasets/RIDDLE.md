## Description

The [Repository of Information on Duplicate Detection, Record Linkage, and Identity
Uncertainty](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/riddle/) (RIDDLE) as set up by PhD student
Misha Bilenko at the University of Texas at Austin in the early 2000.

While it does not seem to be maintained, it still contains several useful resources,
including various smaller data sets and an early database generator.
