tag: synthetic

This tag is for data sets that have been created artificially (synthetic data), or for data generator programs. It should be distinguished from "derived data".
("derived data" refers to data that are derived (via downsampling, aggregation, or other techniques) from actual data. They are typically intended to represent real data. On the other hand, "synthetic data" refers to data that are produced (via simulation or other approaches) from first principles, without access to real data.)
