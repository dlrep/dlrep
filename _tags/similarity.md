tag: similarity
---

This tag is for data sets that only contain similarity or comparson patterns (such as of compared record pair), but not the
actual attribute (field) values of records.

These similarities are also known as weight vectors, where there is one vector per compared record pair. The content of such
vectors can be binary (agreement or disagreement on an attribute value) or numerical (approximate similarities between
attribute values).
